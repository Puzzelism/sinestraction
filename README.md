# Listen
Math is a boring construct made by Big Education to turn you into an assembly line worker- *BUT* it's also really cool to look at...

## Enter Sinestraction

For too long the beauty of mathematics has been gate kept by nobel laureates. Now for the first time ever, thanks to **Sinestraction** you can enjoy the miracle of numbers for yourself.

Watch the waves *dance* as you gleam on in envy with a boatload of features, including but not limited to

 - Adjustable **scale**, and **frequency!**
 - Dynamic **resolution** to be as big as your heart (or your monitor) can take!
 - Play with the smoothing of functions by adjusting the **split factor!**
 - **Stop, start and speed up** time as you see fit!
 - Add **additional waves** so the party never ends!
 - See the action up close and personal with **wireframes!**
 - See the latest in graphics technology with our wave **shadows!**
 - Observe the numbers doing their thing with the **function visualizer!**

 Not to mention so much more to come!
