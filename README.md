**Sinestraction** is the latest craze melting brains throughout schools everywhere

# Listen
Math is a boring construct made by Big Education to turn you into an assembly line worker- *BUT* it's also really cool to look at...

## Enter Sinestraction

For too long the beauty of mathematics has been gate kept by nobel laureates. Now for the first time ever, thanks to **Sinestraction** you can enjoy the miracle of numbers for yourself.

 - Play with the smoothing of the graph by adjusting the **split factor**
 - **Stop, start and speed up** time as you see fit
 - Add **additional waves** so the party never ends

 Not to mention so much more to come!
